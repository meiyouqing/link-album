# Netlify Blobs Refactoring Summary

## Final Architecture (Post-Cleanup)

### Current Active Implementation
- **`lib/api/blobOperations.ts`** - Single source of truth for all blob operations
- **Netlify Functions**: `blob-create.mjs`, `blob-read.mjs`, `blob-delete.mjs`, `blob-move.mjs`
- **Next.js API Routes** - Handle database operations only
- **Frontend** - Calls Next.js API routes, which use blobOperations.ts for file operations

### Deprecated/Cleaned Up
- **`_deprecated/storage-deprecated/`** - Old storage functions with incorrect endpoints
  - These called `/api/blobs/*` instead of correct `/.netlify/functions/blob-*`
  - Moved to `_deprecated` folder to maintain history

## What Was Changed

### 1. Created New Netlify Functions for Blob Operations
- **`netlify/functions/blob-create.mjs`** - Handles file creation/upload
- **`netlify/functions/blob-read.mjs`** - Handles file reading
- **`netlify/functions/blob-delete.mjs`** - Handles file deletion
- **`netlify/functions/blob-move.mjs`** - Handles file moving

### 2. Consolidated Storage Operations
Instead of multiple storage functions with duplicate logic, created a single `blobOperations.ts` that:

- **`createFile()`** - Calls `/.netlify/functions/blob-create`
- **`readFile()`** - Calls `/.netlify/functions/blob-read`
- **`removeFile()`** - Calls `/.netlify/functions/blob-delete`
- **`moveFile()`** - Calls `/.netlify/functions/blob-move`

### 3. Updated netlify.toml
Added redirects for the new blob API endpoints:
- `/api/blobs/create` → `/.netlify/functions/blob-create`
- `/api/blobs/read` → `/.netlify/functions/blob-read`
- `/api/blobs/delete` → `/.netlify/functions/blob-delete`
- `/api/blobs/move` → `/.netlify/functions/blob-move`

### 4. Kept Existing Functions
- **`process-link.mjs`** - Already properly uses Netlify Blobs directly
- **`get-archive.js`** - Already properly uses Netlify Blobs directly

## Architecture Benefits

### Before (Problematic)
```
Next.js API Route → netlifyBlobsClient.ts → @netlify/blobs (may fail outside Netlify Functions)
```

### After (Proper)
```
Next.js API Route → storage function → HTTP request → Netlify Function → @netlify/blobs ✓
```

## What Works Now

1. **All blob operations happen in actual Netlify Functions** where environment is properly configured
2. **Storage functions provide a consistent API** for the rest of the application
3. **Existing API routes continue to work** without changes (they call storage functions)
4. **Archive processing via process-link.mjs works** (direct blob usage)
5. **Archive retrieval via get-archive.js works** (direct blob usage)

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Start the development server: `netlify dev`
2. Run the test script: `node test-blob-functions.js`
3. Test link archiving through the UI
4. Test accessing archived content

### What to Test
- [ ] File upload via API routes (avatars, link archives)
- [ ] File reading via API routes (viewing archives)
- [ ] File deletion when deleting links
- [ ] File moving when moving links between collections
- [ ] Link archiving process (`process-link.mjs`)
- [ ] Archive viewing (`get-archive.js`)

## Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: Make sure `USE_NETLIFY_BLOBS=true` is set
2. **Netlify Environment**: The blob functions will only work in Netlify environment
3. **Error Handling**: All functions include proper CORS and error handling
4. **Metadata**: File metadata is preserved during operations
5. **Content Types**: Automatic content type detection based on file extensions

## Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **Local Development**: Blob functions may not work in `netlify dev` if blobs aren't properly configured
2. **Large Files**: HTTP request/response size limits for blob operations
3. **Performance**: HTTP overhead for internal blob operations vs direct client usage
4. **Rate Limits**: Potential rate limiting on function invocations

## Next Steps

1. Test thoroughly in development environment
2. Deploy to staging and test
3. Monitor performance and error rates
4. Consider implementing batch operations for better performance if needed
