# MissingBlobsEnvironmentError in Production Despite Following Documentation

## **UPDATE: Potential Solution Found**
After further research, I discovered that this issue might be related to **Lambda compatibility mode**. According to the [GitHub documentation](https://github.com/netlify/primitives/tree/main/packages/blobs#lambda-compatibility-mode), functions running in Lambda compatibility mode require manual initialization:

```javascript
import { connectLambda, getStore } from '@netlify/blobs'

export const handler = async (event) => {
  connectLambda(event) // Required for Lambda compatibility mode

  const store = getStore('my-store')
  // ... rest of function
}
```

**Question: How can I determine if my functions are running in Lambda compatibility mode, and is this the correct solution?**

## Problem Description
I'm experiencing a persistent `MissingBlobsEnvironmentError` in my production Netlify Functions when using Netlify Blobs, despite following the official documentation and implementing the recommended authentication patterns.

## Error Details
```
ERROR Uncaught Exception 
{
  "errorType": "MissingBlobsEnvironmentError",
  "errorMessage": "The environment has not been configured to use Netlify Blobs. To use it manually, supply the following properties when creating a store: siteID, token",

    "    at Module.require (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1487:12)"
  ]
}
```

## Current Implementation
I'm using the two-parameter `getStore()` signature as shown in the documentation, with environment-specific credential handling:

```javascript
import { getStore } from '@netlify/blobs';

// Current implementation following documentation
const fileStore = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' 
  ? getStore('link-album-files', {
      siteID: process.env.NETLIFY_SITE_ID,
      token: process.env.NETLIFY_BLOBS_TOKEN
    })
  : getStore('link-album-files'); // No options object in production
```

## Environment Details
- **Package Version:** `@netlify/blobs@10.0.9`
- **Function Type:** Netlify Functions (not Edge Functions)
- **Node.js Runtime:** Default (should be 18.x+)
- **Site ID:** `d06490d5-32fd-4c46-a6d4-75645e45abbb`
- **Local Development:** Works perfectly with explicit credentials
- **Production:** Fails with MissingBlobsEnvironmentError

## Functions Affected
Multiple functions using the same pattern:
- `blob-create.mjs`
- `blob-read.mjs` 
- `blob-delete.mjs`
- `blob-move.mjs`
- `get-archive.js`
- `process-link.mjs`

## What I've Tried

### 1. Original approach with single object parameter:
```javascript
// Tried this first
const fileStore = getStore({
  name: 'link-album-files'
});
```

### 2. Conditional credentials with spread operator:
```javascript
// Also tried this
const fileStore = getStore({
  name: 'link-album-files',
  ...(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? {
    siteID: process.env.NETLIFY_SITE_ID,
    token: process.env.NETLIFY_BLOBS_TOKEN
  } : {})
});
```

### 3. Current approach following documentation exactly:
```javascript
// Current implementation
const fileStore = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' 
  ? getStore('link-album-files', { 
      siteID: process.env.NETLIFY_SITE_ID, 
      token: process.env.NETLIFY_BLOBS_TOKEN 
    })
  : getStore('link-album-files');
```

## Documentation References
According to the [Netlify Blobs API documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/build/data-and-storage/netlify-blobs/#api-reference):

> `siteID` (optional): this is set automatically when you use Blobs from Functions, Edge Functions or Build Plugins
> 
> `token` (optional): this is set automatically when you use Blobs from Functions, Edge Functions or Build Plugins

The documentation suggests that when running in Netlify's environment, these credentials should be automatically provided.

## Questions
1. **Is there a specific environment variable** that Netlify sets to indicate the function is running in production that I should check instead of `NODE_ENV`?

2. **Are there any deployment settings** or site configuration requirements for automatic credential injection to work?

3. **Could this be related to the function bundling process** where environment detection isn't working as expected?

4. **Is there a way to debug** what environment variables are available in the production function context?

## Expected Behavior
Based on the documentation, calling `getStore('store-name')` without credentials in a Netlify Function should automatically have `siteID` and `token` injected by the platform.

## Actual Behavior
The function throws `MissingBlobsEnvironmentError` suggesting that automatic credential injection is not occurring.

## Additional Context
- The same codebase works perfectly in local development when providing explicit credentials
- This is a hybrid Next.js + Netlify Functions architecture
- All functions are properly deployed and visible in the Netlify dashboard
- The site has Netlify Blobs enabled and other Netlify features work correctly

## Local Development Configuration
For reference, my local `.env.local` contains:
```bash
NETLIFY_SITE_ID=d06490d5-32fd-4c46-a6d4-75645e45abbb
NETLIFY_BLOBS_TOKEN=****************************
```

Any guidance on troubleshooting this issue or understanding why automatic credential injection isn't working would be greatly appreciated!
